#  Exploring Google Play Store App Reviews


This is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project I worked on to dive into user sentiment, popular app categories, and review patterns. It's a mix of data cleaning, visualization, and a bit of natural language processing.

##  What's This About?

I wanted to understand how users feel about the apps they use every day. So, I took a dataset of Google Play Store reviews and asked questions like:

- Are most reviews positive or negative?
- Which app categories get the best (or worst) feedback?
- What do people complain about the most?
- Do longer reviews mean angrier users?

This project helped me turn messy review data into clear, useful insights.

##  Tools I Used

Here’s what I used to build this project:

Python  
Jupyter Notebook  
Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling  
Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations  
TextBlob or VADER for sentiment analysis  
WordCloud for  visualization of words

##  What I Found

A few interesting insights from the data:

- Most users are pretty happy — over 60 percent of the reviews are positive
- Communication and Social app categories get the most reviews
- The top complaints are crashes, bugs, and ads
- Longer reviews are usually more negative — users have more to say when upset
